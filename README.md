In this demo project, I have shown how to upload the necessary libraries and calculate the MACCS keys using rdkit for the SMILES followed by loading several regression models and selecting the best one for prediction.
This app is run using streamlit.

How to build similar app :
1. Run the ipynb file and save the model in pkl format.
2. once done run the command "streamlit run app.py" and make predictions.

Thanks
